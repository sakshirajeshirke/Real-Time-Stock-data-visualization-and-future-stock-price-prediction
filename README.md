## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/stock-prediction-dashboard.git
   cd stock-prediction-dashboard
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the Streamlit application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run pred.py
   ```

2. The dashboard will open in your default web browser at `http://localhost:8501`

3. Select ticker symbols, time period, and configuration options in the sidebar

4. Click "Run Analysis" to generate charts, indicators, and predictions

## Configuration Options

- **Stock Tickers**: Choose from popular stocks or enter your own
- **Historical Data Period**: Select how far back to analyze (1y, 2y, 5y, 10y)
- **Prediction Horizon**: Set how many days to forecast into the future
- **LSTM Model Complexity**: Adjust the complexity of the neural network
- **Technical Indicators**: Enable/disable various technical indicators

## How It Works

1. **Data Collection**: Historical price data is fetched from Yahoo Finance API
2. **Technical Analysis**: Indicators are calculated to identify potential trends and signals
3. **Prediction Model**: An LSTM neural network is trained on historical price data
4. **Future Forecasting**: The model predicts future price movements based on learned patterns

## Technical Details

### Libraries Used

- **Data Manipulation**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Data Visualization**: Plotly, Matplotlib
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn
- **Web Interface**: Streamlit
- **Financial Data**: yfinance

### Machine Learning Model

The price prediction uses a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network architecture:
- Input layer with lookback period
- LSTM layers with dropout for regularization
- Dense output layer for price prediction
- Early stopping to prevent overfitting

## Limitations

- Predictions are based on historical patterns and may not accurately predict future market movements
- Market events, news, and external factors can significantly impact stock prices
- The model performs best in trending markets and may struggle during highly volatile periods
- Limited to technical analysis; fundamental analysis is not included
